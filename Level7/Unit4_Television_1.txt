A: I almost always watch the serious TV shows like documentaries. And I never missed the news. Cable TV has a lot of great news channels. I can't stand silly comedies. I absolutely hate reality shows. People do stupid things just on TV. Once in a while, when I was visiting my mother, I watched soap operas but I don't really care for them. Oh, and I watch weather show every morning befor I leave for work. 

B: My job is ???. So, I get home. I generally like to something I like. You know something funny like sitcom. I'm crazy on science programs. And I'm totally addicted on science fiction. I watched anything except ????. I also watched dramas like crime shows, Westerns. I seldom, I should say never watch game shows. Occasionally, I watch sports like football game with my friend Jack. I watch a lot of TV. Sally calls me a couch potato.
