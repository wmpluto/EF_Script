A: A new TV commercial. Exciting.

B: The marketing department has 3 ideas. And I want a feedback. 

A: Ok, let's have a look at. A dancing computer? 

B: Yeah, I'm not crazy about the humor. 

A: A jingle. It's just annoying. 

B: I know, but never mind. That's only the first idea. There are two more. 

B: Well, I like the second one better than the first. 

A: I do too. I prefer it because it gives real information about our company products. 

B: What do you think of the new slogan? 

A: I'm not keen on that. You can count on us. 

B: I can't like it. Let's look at the third one. 

A: ???????. He's pretty famous. 

B: That's the idea. 

A: But he knows anything about software. 

B: Probably not. 

A: Well, for me, No.2 is the best. ????????.  

B: Me too. Thanks for your input, Todd. Before you go, can you take a look at the new logo.
