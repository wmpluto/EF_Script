B: So, what are you going to do? Let's look at your choices. If you get a job now, you'll make money soon. But if you go to law school, you'll make a lot of money. And if you join a Peace Corps...

A: I won't make money ever.

C: Peace Corps? Ama, you're thinking about Peace Corps?

B: Ama's going to apply.

C: Ama?

A: Dad, I just want to make something good. You get me so much and I am so grateful. Now, I want to go out. I want to help people. I think if I join Peace Corps, I'll really help people, I'll give something back.

B: So, very ???.

C: I know kids go up. They move out of the house. They get jobs. They get married. She's talking about the Peace Corps. She'll be so far away. But she will help people. If she move abroad, she'll learn another language. She'll get a lot of things, meet a lot of new people. Yeah. But it's dangerous. She will be far away and I won't see her in two years. I worry so much.

C: Why don't you just stay with me? With us.

A: Well, I don't know yet. My future is, emm, undecided.
