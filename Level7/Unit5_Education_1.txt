A: I went a public elementary school in New York city. I love it but when I went to middle school, the classes were big and my grades went down. So for high school, my parents moved me to a private school. It was expensive but the teachers were really good. Most of them had master degrees or doctorates. After high school, I went to New York University. I received a bachelor degree in litreature. I reall learned a lot so it worthed it. At least, my parents thought so.

B: I grew up in Coventry in England and I went to school there. I went on to university ????.. and studied for a joint degree in economic and mathmatics. It did a BA in business management. Then, I did a MBA at University of Michgan. It was challenging for me living far from my family and friends to study in US. I really learned a lot about American culture and I became addicted to hot dogs.
